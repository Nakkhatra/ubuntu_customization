# ubuntu_customization
Ubuntu 20.04 full look customization with custom themes, dash to dock and conky widgets. I'm using the whitesur-dark theme for my shell, orchis-dark-compact for my applications. While I love the whitesur-dark shell theme, I don't like to see that apple icon on my top left corner of the screen for the activities button.
